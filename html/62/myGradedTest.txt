There were 3 things wrong. (I have since fixed them)
1. Text was not justified. 
2. On large screens, one picture (the candy) was slightly bigger.
3. On small screens when the table scrolled, the beginning of it was cut off. (Even when you scrolled to the beginning, it wouldn't show the first column. I figured out that it had to do with the fact that it was centered on the page.)
